- Human Behavior is always changing : situation to situation, moment to moment, second to second. But what doesn't change is the fundaments of human behavior.

# The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits :

# Why tiny habits make a big difference :
- It is easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.
- Too often, We convince ourselves that massive success requires massive actions. Whether 
	- it is losing weight.
	- building a business.
	- writing a book.
	- winning a championship.
	- Achieving any other goal.
- We put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.

## Meanwhile, If you get 1 percent better each day for one year. you'll end up 37 times better by the time you're done. OR if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you'll decline nearly down to zero.

## If you want to predict where you'll end up in life, all you have to follow the curve of tiny gain and tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line.

## Time Magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time you ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

## Habits are a double-edged sword. Bad Habits can cut you down just as easily as Good habits build you up.

## Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.
