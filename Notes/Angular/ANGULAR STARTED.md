# How angular apps get loaded and started?
Angular apps follow a specific lifecycle to get loaded and started. Here's a general overview of how the process works:

1. **Index.html**: The entry point of an Angular application is usually an `index.html` file. This file contains the basic structure of the web page and includes references to CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and the Angular application main file (`main.ts`).

2. **main.ts**: The `main.ts` file is the entry point for the Angular application. It is a TypeScript file that bootstraps the application using Angular's platform-specific bootstrapping method called `platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)`. The `AppModule` is the root module of the application.

3. **AppModule**: The `AppModule` is an Angular module that serves as the root module for the application. It is defined in a TypeScript file (usually named `app.module.ts`). The module imports and declares other modules, components, services, and other application elements that are used in the app.

4. **Component Rendering**: Angular applications are built using components. When the application starts, Angular looks for the main component (usually called `AppComponent`) specified in the `AppModule` and renders it into the `index.html` file.

5. **Module and Component Resolution**: As the application starts to render the main component, Angular resolves the dependencies and imports of the modules and components specified in the `AppModule`.

6. **Bootstrap Process**: Angular bootstraps the application by creating the necessary dependency injection (DI) container, setting up the application environment, and starting the change detection mechanism.

7. **Template Rendering**: Angular uses the component templates to generate HTML views, which are then rendered on the browser. The templates are written using Angular's template syntax, which allows for dynamic rendering and data binding.

8. **Change Detection**: Angular continuously monitors for changes in the application's data and triggers the change detection mechanism to update the view when necessary.

9. **User Interaction and Routing**: Once the application is loaded and the main component is rendered, users can interact with the application through events like clicks, form submissions, etc. If the application uses Angular Router, navigating to different routes will load the corresponding components and update the view accordingly.

10. **Services and Backend Interaction**: Angular applications often communicate with backend servers to fetch data or perform other operations. This is typically done using Angular services that use HTTP modules to make API requests.

11. **Lifecycle Hooks**: Throughout the app's lifecycle, components may go through various lifecycle hooks like `ngOnInit`, `ngOnChanges`, `ngAfterViewInit`, etc. These hooks allow developers to execute custom code at specific stages of a component's lifecycle.

Overall, Angular's bootstrapping process ensures that the application is properly initialized, components are rendered, and the necessary data binding and change detection mechanisms are set up for a smooth user experience.
