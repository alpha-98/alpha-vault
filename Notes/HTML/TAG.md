[[HTML]]

#html/tag
# [Tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tag):
- In HTML, a tag is used for creating a [[ELEMENT]].
- Tags consist of the element name surrounded by "`<`" and "`>`".
- The name of an HTML element is the name that appears at the beginning of the element's start tag and at the end of the element's end tag (if the element has an end tag).
- The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.
- Examples : 
	- the `p` in the `<p>` start/opening tag and `</p>` end/closing tag is the name of the HTML paragraph element.

#NOTE 
### an element name in an end/closing tag is *preceded* by a *slash* character: `</p>`, and that for [void elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element), the end tag is neither required nor allowed.

### Elements and Tags are _not_ the same things. Tags begin or end an element in source code, whereas elements are part of the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM), the document model for displaying the page in the [browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browser).
