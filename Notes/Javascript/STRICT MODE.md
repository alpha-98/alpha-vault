- Strict mode is a special mode that we can activate in javascript.
- Which make easier for us to write a secure JS code.

- To activate strict mode use below string. it has to be the very first statement in the script.
	```javascript
	'use strict';
	```

#NOTE
- If we have any code before this above string then strict mode will not be activated.
- We actually can also activate strict mode, only for a specific function and a specific block. but it's not have any significant advantage so Always use it at beginning of each script.
