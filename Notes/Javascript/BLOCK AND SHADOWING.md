[[JAVASCRIPT]]
In JavaScript, a block is a delimited section of code that is surrounded by a pair of curly braces (`{}`) and can contain multiple statements. Blocks are commonly used to group statements together and define the scope of variables.

1. Block Scope:
   - Variables declared with `let` and `const` keywords have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined.
   - Block scope allows for more fine-grained control over variables and helps prevent naming conflicts or unintended variable access outside of the block.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     function myFunction() {
       let x = 10;

       if (true) {
         let y = 20;
         console.log(x + y);  // Accessible: x and y are within the same block
       }

       console.log(x);  // Accessible: x is within the outer block
       console.log(y);  // Error: y is not accessible outside of its block
     }

     myFunction();
     ```

2. Variable Shadowing:
   - Variable shadowing occurs when a variable with the same name is declared in an inner block, effectively "hiding" the variable with the same name in an outer block.
   - When a variable is shadowed, the inner variable takes precedence over the outer variable within the scope of the inner block.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let x = 10;

     function myFunction() {
       let x = 20;  // Shadowing the outer x variable

       console.log(x);  // Output: 20 (inner x)
     }

     myFunction();
     console.log(x);  // Output: 10 (outer x)
     ```

   - Shadowing can occur between any nested blocks, including functions, loops, and conditionals.
   - It's important to be mindful of variable shadowing to avoid confusion and potential bugs. To mitigate shadowing-related issues, it's generally recommended to use different variable names or consider refactoring the code structure if necessary.

Blocks and variable shadowing are important concepts for scoping and managing variables in JavaScript. Understanding how blocks and scope work together allows you to control variable access and organize your code more effectively.
