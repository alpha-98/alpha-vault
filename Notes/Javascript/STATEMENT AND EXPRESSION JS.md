In JavaScript, statements and expressions are fundamental concepts that are used to write and execute code. Let's understand each concept separately:

1. Statement:
A statement is a complete instruction or a command that performs a specific action. In JavaScript, statements typically end with a semicolon (`;`). Some common types of statements include variable declarations, loops, conditionals, function declarations, and assignments.

Example of statements:
```javascript
var x = 5; // variable declaration and assignment statement

if (x > 0) { // if statement
  console.log("x is positive."); // console.log statement
}

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) { // for loop statement
  console.log(i);
}
```

In the above examples, each line represents a statement. The `var x = 5;` statement declares a variable `x` and assigns it the value `5`. The `if` statement checks a condition and executes a block of code based on the result. The `for` loop statement repeats a block of code multiple times.

Statements are executed sequentially, one after another, and they can have side effects such as modifying variables, controlling program flow, or interacting with the environment.

2. Expression:
An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a single value. Expressions can be as simple as a single constant value or as complex as a combination of nested sub-expressions.

Example of expressions:
```javascript
5 + 3 // addition expression

x * (y + 2) // nested expression

foo() // function call expression

x > 0 // comparison expression
```

In the above examples, each line represents an expression. The `5 + 3` expression evaluates to the value `8`. The `(y + 2)` expression represents a nested expression, where the value of `y` is added to `2`. The `foo()` expression calls a function named `foo`. The `x > 0` expression compares the value of `x` with `0` and evaluates to a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

Expressions are used to compute values, and they can be used within larger expressions or as part of statements. They can also be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to functions, or used as conditions in conditional statements.

It's important to note that in JavaScript, some statements (such as expression statements) can include expressions within them. For example, the assignment statement `x = 5;` includes the expression `5` as the value being assigned to `x`.

Understanding the distinction between statements and expressions helps in writing structured and meaningful code. Statements provide the structure and control flow of your program, while expressions are the building blocks that compute values and perform operations.



# what difference in expression statements and expression?
In JavaScript, expressions and expression statements are related concepts but differ in their usage and context. Let's explore the difference between them:

1. Expression:
An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a single value. It represents a computation or a calculation that produces a result.

Examples of expressions:
```javascript
5 + 3 // Addition expression
x * (y + 2) // Nested expression
foo() // Function call expression
x > 0 // Comparison expression
```

In the above examples, each line represents an expression. Expressions can be used to compute values, and they can appear within larger expressions or statements. They do not have any side effects and are evaluated to produce a value.

2. Expression Statement:
An expression statement is a statement that includes an expression. It is a type of statement that evaluates an expression but does not necessarily use or assign its resulting value. Expression statements are often used for their side effects rather than the computed value.

Examples of expression statements:
```javascript
x = 5; // Assignment statement with expression
console.log("Hello"); // Function call statement with expression
```

In the above examples, the lines with `x = 5;` and `console.log("Hello");` are expression statements. These statements include expressions (`x = 5` and `console.log("Hello")`), but the resulting values are not used or assigned to any variable. Instead, the expressions perform side effects like modifying variables (`x`) or producing output (`console.log`).

Expression statements are used when you want to perform an action or execute a function for its side effects rather than capturing and using the resulting value.

To summarize, the main difference between expressions and expression statements is that expressions compute values and can be used within larger expressions or statements, while expression statements include expressions but are primarily used for their side effects rather than the resulting value.
