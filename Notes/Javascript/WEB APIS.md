Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in JavaScript are sets of functionalities and methods provided by web browsers to interact with various aspects of web development. These APIs allow JavaScript code to access and control different features of web browsers and their environments. Web APIs enable developers to build dynamic and interactive web applications.

Some common categories of web APIs include:

1. **[[DOM API]]**: The DOM API provides methods and properties to access and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. It allows you to dynamically modify the structure, content, and style of HTML and XML documents.
    
2. **AJAX API**: AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) APIs enable communication between the web browser and a server, allowing you to send HTTP requests, retrieve data in various formats (such as JSON or XML), and update parts of a web page without reloading the entire page.
    
3. **Geolocation API**: The Geolocation API allows web applications to access the user's geographical location information, with their permission. It provides methods to retrieve latitude, longitude, and other related data.
    
4. **Canvas API**: The Canvas API enables dynamic rendering and manipulation of graphics, images, and animations on a web page. It provides a drawing surface where you can create and modify pixel-based images using JavaScript.
    
5. **Audio and Video API**: These APIs allow you to work with multimedia elements, such as audio and video, on a web page. They provide methods to control playback, volume, seek positions, and more.
    
6. **Storage API**: The Storage API provides mechanisms for web applications to store data locally within the user's browser. It includes `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` for persistent and session-based data storage, respectively.
    
7. **Fetch API**: The Fetch API provides a modern alternative to the older XMLHttpRequest (XHR) for making HTTP requests. It offers a more flexible and powerful way to retrieve resources and handle responses asynchronously.
    
8. **WebSocket API**: The WebSocket API enables real-time, bidirectional communication between a web browser and a server. It establishes a persistent connection that allows both the server and the client to send data to each other at any time.
    

These are just a few examples of the many web APIs available in JavaScript. Each API serves a specific purpose and provides functionality to enhance web development by accessing and controlling various web browser features and capabilities.
