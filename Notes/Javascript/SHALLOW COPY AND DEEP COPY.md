In JavaScript, shallow copy and deep copy are two approaches used to create copies of objects or arrays. The main difference between them lies in how they handle nested objects or arrays within the original object or array being copied.

1. Shallow Copy:
A shallow copy creates a new object or array and copies the references of the nested objects or arrays. In other words, the top-level structure is duplicated, but the nested objects or arrays are still shared between the original and the copied version.

Here's an example of shallow copy:

```javascript
let originalArray = [1, 2, [3, 4]];
let shallowCopy = originalArray.slice();

originalArray[0] = 5;
originalArray[2][0] = 6;

console.log(originalArray);   // Output: [5, 2, [6, 4]]
console.log(shallowCopy);     // Output: [1, 2, [6, 4]]
```

In the above example, `slice()` is used to create a shallow copy of the `originalArray`. Both `originalArray` and `shallowCopy` initially have the same values. However, when we modify the nested array `[3, 4]` by changing its first element to 6, the change is reflected in both the original array and the shallow copy. This is because the nested array is shared between them.

2. Deep Copy:
A deep copy creates a completely independent copy of an object or array, including all nested objects or arrays. Each level of the object or array is recursively copied, ensuring that any changes made to the copied version do not affect the original.

Here's an example of deep copy:

```javascript
let originalArray = [1, 2, [3, 4]];
let deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalArray));

originalArray[0] = 5;
originalArray[2][0] = 6;

console.log(originalArray);   // Output: [5, 2, [6, 4]]
console.log(deepCopy);        // Output: [1, 2, [3, 4]]
```

In this example, `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` is used to create a deep copy of the `originalArray`. The `stringify()` function converts the original array to a JSON string, and then `parse()` function parses the JSON string back into a new array. This process creates a completely independent copy, so modifying the nested array in the original array does not affect the deep copy.

# JOSN function limitation:
It's important to note that deep copying using `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` has some limitations. It cannot handle certain types of data, such as functions or object properties with circular references. In such cases, you may need to use specialized libraries or implement custom deep copy functions to ensure a proper copy is made.

When the standard `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` method is insufficient for deep copying complex objects or arrays, you can either use specialized libraries or implement custom deep copy functions. Let's explore both options:

1. Specialized Libraries:
Several popular JavaScript libraries provide deep copy functionality, such as Lodash, jQuery, and Ramda. These libraries offer functions like `cloneDeep()` in Lodash, `$.extend(true, {}, object)` in jQuery, and `R.clone()` in Ramda. These functions are designed to handle complex data structures and perform deep copies reliably.

Here's an example using Lodash:

```javascript
const _ = require('lodash');

let originalObject = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
let deepCopy = _.cloneDeep(originalObject);

originalObject.a = 5;
originalObject.b.c = 10;

console.log(originalObject);  // Output: { a: 5, b: { c: 10 } }
console.log(deepCopy);        // Output: { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } }
```

2. Custom Deep Copy Functions:
If you prefer not to rely on external libraries, you can implement a custom deep copy function. This involves recursively traversing the object or array, creating new instances for each nested object or array.

Here's an example of a custom deep copy function for objects:

```javascript
function deepCopy(obj) {
  if (typeof obj !== 'object' || obj === null) {
    return obj;
  }

  let copy = Array.isArray(obj) ? [] : {};

  for (let key in obj) {
    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, key)) {
      copy[key] = deepCopy(obj[key]);
    }
  }

  return copy;
}

let originalObject = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
let deepCopy = deepCopy(originalObject);

originalObject.a = 5;
originalObject.b.c = 10;

console.log(originalObject);  // Output: { a: 5, b: { c: 10 } }
console.log(deepCopy);        // Output: { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } }
```

In this example, the `deepCopy()` function checks if the input is an object or array. If it is, it creates a new empty object or array. Then, it iterates over the properties of the original object or elements of the array, recursively calling `deepCopy()` on each value and assigning it to the corresponding property in the copy.

By using specialized libraries or implementing custom deep copy functions, you can ensure that complex objects or arrays are correctly and deeply copied, allowing you to work with independent copies of the data.
