In JavaScript, `let`, `var`, and `const` are used to declare variables. Each keyword has different scoping and mutability characteristics. When used to declare variables, they exhibit the following differences:

1. `var`:
- Function scope: Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible within the function they are declared in, regardless of block boundaries.
- Hoisting: Variable declarations with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the assignment.
- Reassignment and redeclaration: Variables declared with `var` can be both reassigned and redeclared within their scope.
- No block scope: `var` variables are not block-scoped, which means they can be accessed outside of the block in which they are defined.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  function example() {
    var x = 5;
    if (true) {
      var x = 10; // This reassigns the existing 'x'
      console.log(x); // Output: 10
    }
    console.log(x); // Output: 10
  }
  ```

2. `let`:
- Block scope: Variables declared with `let` are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are declared in (e.g., within an if statement or a loop).
- No redeclaration: Variables declared with `let` cannot be redeclared within the same scope.
- Reassignment: `let` variables can be reassigned to new values.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  function example() {
    let x = 5;
    if (true) {
      let x = 10; // This creates a new block-scoped 'x'
      console.log(x); // Output: 10
    }
    console.log(x); // Output: 5
  }
  ```

3. `const`:
- Block scope: Variables declared with `const` are block-scoped, just like `let` variables.
- No redeclaration and no reassignment: Variables declared with `const` cannot be redeclared or reassigned. They are constants and their values remain fixed.
- Initialization required: `const` variables must be initialized with a value at the time of declaration.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  function example() {
    const x = 5;
    if (true) {
      const x = 10; // This creates a new block-scoped 'x'
      console.log(x); // Output: 10
    }
    console.log(x); // Output: 5
  }
  ```

If you declare a variable without using any of these keywords (`let`, `var`, `const`), it becomes implicitly global if it is declared outside of any function or block. Implicit global variables are generally discouraged as they can lead to unintended consequences and make the code harder to reason about. It is recommended to always use `let`, `var`, or `const` for explicit scoping and to avoid polluting the global scope.



# Temporal Dead Zone : 
Apologies for the confusion in the previous response. You are correct, `let` and `const` variables are hoisted but they are subject to a behavior called the "Temporal Dead Zone" (TDZ). The Temporal Dead Zone is a specific phase during the variable's lifecycle that occurs after hoisting but before the variable is declared and assigned a value.

Here's how the Temporal Dead Zone works for `let` and `const` variables:

1. Hoisting: Like `var` variables, `let` and `const` declarations are hoisted to the top of their respective scopes. This means you can refer to the variables before they are declared. However, there's a difference in behavior between `var` and `let`/`const`.

2. Temporal Dead Zone: During the Temporal Dead Zone, accessing `let` and `const` variables before their declaration will result in a ReferenceError. This means that while the variables are hoisted, you cannot access or use them until they are declared.

3. Variable Declaration: The variable enters the Temporal Dead Zone and remains inaccessible until the point of declaration. Once the variable is declared, it can be accessed and used normally.

4. Variable Assignment: After the declaration, the `let` variable can be reassigned with a new value, while `const` variables cannot be reassigned. `const` variables are read-only and cannot change their assigned value.

Here's an example to illustrate the Temporal Dead Zone:

```javascript
console.log(x); // Output: ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
let x = 5;
```

In the above code, even though `x` is hoisted, accessing it before its declaration results in a ReferenceError. This is because `x` is in the Temporal Dead Zone until it is formally declared.

The Temporal Dead Zone is introduced for `let` and `const` variables to catch potential bugs caused by accessing variables before they are declared. It promotes good programming practices and helps identify issues that could arise due to hoisting.

To avoid running into the Temporal Dead Zone, it's a best practice to declare `let` and `const` variables at the beginning of the scope, before accessing or using them.

In summary, `let` and `const` variables are hoisted but have a Temporal Dead Zone where accessing them before their declaration results in a ReferenceError. This behavior is introduced to catch potential bugs and encourage good programming practices.
