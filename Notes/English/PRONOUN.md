- Relative pronouns are words that connect a dependent clause (also called a relative clause) to an independent clause.
- They act like pronouns by referring back to a noun (or another pronoun) mentioned earlier in the sentence, called the `antecedent`.
- **Who:** Refers to people.
- **Which:** Refers to things or animals (sometimes used for people in a formal tone).
- **That:** Can refer to people or things and is generally considered more casual than "who" or "which." However, it can also be used in defining clauses (which provide essential information about the noun they modify).
- **Whose:** Shows possession for people and animals (less commonly used for things).
- **Example:**
	- **Independent Clause:** The student **(who studies hard)** gets good grades.
	- **Dependent Clause:** (who studies hard)
	- **Antecedent:** student
