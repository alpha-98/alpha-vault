# let and const
- It is recommended to use **const** on your variables to reduce the risk of bugs in your program. use **let** when you are sure that that variable can change in some point in the future in the program.

# type conversion vs coercion
- when type manually convert to another type it's called conversion.
- when type automatically convert to it's appropriate type it's called coercion.

# NaN
- it's a `typeof` Number Somehow.
- But it's a invalid Number.
