# Data structure :
1. So basically the data structure is divided into two major groups, the primitive and the non primitive data structures.
2. Primitive data type are data types that any programming language is going to give you to implement data. Like integer,float,boolean,character etc.
3. Non-Primitive data type are further classified into linear and non-linear data structure.
	1. Linear data structure is again divided into static and dynamic data structure.
		1. static : array
		2. dynamic : linked-list, stack and queue implementation.
	2. Non-linear data structure are trees and graph as implementation.
